# PyCatch
A simple python version of the game Catch using pygame.

This game was developed within a group project during my computer science studies.

It is a simple port of a 'Catch' game. Using the mouse, the player can score points when balls are caught, and the player can lose a life when a bomb is caught.

Originally, the game is not played using the mouse, but using image recognition. It was loaded on a Raspberry Pi with a camera connected, and with the use of openCV, an object can be tracked and the bucket in the game can be horizontally controlled. This repository only contains the game, not the image recognition parts, which might be added later.
